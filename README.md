This project recreates a working version of the project provided as an example at
https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-spring/issues/270
Using a JUnit5 test to show that it passes. Still not sure why the original Spock test fails.

Building and running this project also requires the subproject `examples:micronaut-lib`
from guthub.com:jamesdh/micronaut-spring.git (i.e. publishToMavenLocal)
